1. **API Integration:**
- Connect your Flutter application to a backend server using HTTP requests, commonly through RESTful APIs.
- Define API endpoints for user registration and authentication.
2. **User Input**:
- Create a signup form in your Flutter app with fields like username, email, password, and any other required user information.
- Validate user input on the client side to ensure data integrity.
3. **HTTP Request**:
- When the user submits the signup form, send a POST request to the registration API endpoint.
- Include user input data in the request body, typically as JSON.
4. **Response Handling:**
- Handle API responses in your Flutter app. Typically, a successful response will include a user token or a confirmation message.
- Implement error handling to address registration failures or validation errors.
5. **Local Storage:**
- Store the user token securely on the device after successful registration. You may use packages like shared_preferences or flutter_secure_storage for this purpose.
6. **Image Upload**:
- Profile Picture Selection
- Allow users to select or capture profile pictures using the device's camera or gallery.
7. **Image Compression:**
- Compress the selected image to reduce its size before uploading. This helps save bandwidth and storage space.
8. **API Endpoint**:
- Create an API endpoint for image uploads on your backend server. The API should handle image reception and storage.
9. **HTTP Request**:
- Send a POST request to the image upload API endpoint with the user's profile picture data as part of the request body.
10. **Server-Side Processing**:
- On the server side, process the image, perform any necessary resizing or formatting, and store it in a secure location.
11. **Response Handling:**
- Receive a response from the image upload API, indicating whether the upload was successful. Include a link to the uploaded image in the response.
12. **Update User Profile**:
- Update the user's profile on the client side with the new image URL received from the server.
